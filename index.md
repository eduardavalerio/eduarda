My name is Eduarda, I'm 20, and I'm an ungraduate student at Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo (USP).
Since the first year of the course I'm doing a cientific initiation in molecular ecology and genetic fields, working with environmental DNA and Metabarcode approach for marine conservation and biodiversity monitoring. Furthermore, I'm using DNA Barcode of marine species not cataloged in genetic sequences databases. I'm currently doing an academic research fully funded by The São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) at School of Science, Engineering and Environment at University of Salford in United Kingdom.
I'm interesting in environmental sciences, specifically in marine ecology and ocean dynamics and the relation between these areas.
