## Visiting research at University of Salford, 2024

I'd the experience of staying four months in the city of Manchester, UK doing an academic research at the Ecosystems and Environment Research Centre (EERC), University of Salford. 
In this time, I did DNA metabarcoding for fish using enviromental samples from island of the coast of SÃ£o Paulo, bioinformatics and data analysis of these samples.
