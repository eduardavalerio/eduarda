### DNA barcoding and metabarcoding as tools to show the biodiversity of the groups porifera, cnidaria and fish from environmental DNA
### Process no. FAPESP 2022/14631-1

My scientific initiation project explore the molecular biology tools, DNA barcoding and DNA metabarcoding, to implement data in sequences databases and for the biodiversity survey using environment samples. 

### Sampling 
The sampling process occured in 2023/2024 in summer and winter in four coastal islands in the state of São Paulo, Alcatrazes Archipelago, Queimada Grande Island, Laje de Santos Marine State Park and Búzios Island. In each island was collected 36 samples in 6 differents sites around the island, in each site the sampling was realized in triplicate in the surface and 10 meters deep.

### Laboratory work 
The previously collected samples went through the steps of DNA extraction, PCR, clean-up, library preparation and sequencing, these steps are being carried out at the School of Science, Engineering and Environment at the University of Salford with the samples collected in 2023.

### Bioinformatics and Data Analyses 
The last step is transforming all the sequences we had into results, for this, we use pipelines for bioinformatics in R programming language. You can see some scripts for data analyses of barcode of the phylum Porifera in my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eduardavalerio/Ecological-analyses-of-porifera-IC-FAPESP)
